# Enterprise Computing

This repository contains a series of projects developed for the Enterprise Computing course. Each project focuses on different aspects of enterprise-level software systems, from frontend design to backend processing and systems integration.

## üìÅ Projects

- **Project-1**: Developed a Java application that creates a standalone GUI application that simulates an e-store. We‚Äôll call our store ShopTrip.com... we‚Äôre not quite as big as Amazon.com! 1 The application will allow the user to place in stock items into a shopping cart and once all items are included, total all costs (including tax), produce an invoice, and append a transaction log file.
- **Project-2**: Developed an application which requires cooperating, synchronized
multiple threads of execution.
- **Project-3**: Developed two-tier Java based client-server applications interacting with a MySQL database utilizing JDBC for the connectivity. This project is designed to give you some experience using the various features of JDBC and its interaction with a MySQL DB Server environment.
- **Project-4**: Enhanced the Project-3 client-server system by introducing a user authentication page with login redirection to the main application. Replaced traditional Java-based front-end with JSP for a cleaner, server-rendered interface and better maintainability.

Each project is self-contained and may include source code, documentation, and test cases.

## üõ† Technologies

- Java
- JSP / Servlets
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
